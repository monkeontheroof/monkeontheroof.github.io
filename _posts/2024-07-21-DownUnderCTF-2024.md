Hello everyone, this is my first blog post as I officially join a CTF competition for the first time (although I didn't get higher ranking). DownUnderCTF 2024 is quite interesting and beginner friendly, let's dive into some Web Challenges!!<br>

Take a look at `app.py`, we can see that at line 10 our input is directly passed into `render_template_string()` without filtering or sanitization, then result will be rendered using `index.html` template 
> "Since autoescaping is enabled for all strings when using render_template_string() so there is no XSS here" <br>
