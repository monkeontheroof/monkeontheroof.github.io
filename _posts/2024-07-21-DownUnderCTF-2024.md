Hello everyone, this is my first blog post as I officially join a CTF competition for the first time (although I didn't get higher ranking). DownUnderCTF 2024 is quite interesting and beginner friendly, let's dive into some Web Challenges!!<br>

# parrot the emu (100 pts)
Come to our first challenge, I was given the source code attachment and challenge URL.<br>

After investigating, I found that this site uses Flask as a web framework and has a feature that prints back anything I entered

Take a look at `app.py`, we can see that at line 12 our input is passed directly into `render_template_string()` without filtering or sanitization, then the appended result will be rendered using `index.html`. <br>
![app.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f5393b-1582-447e-b334-740379909e8c) <br>
This may have the potential for SSTI since my input is passed directly into template rather than passed in as data
> "Since autoescaping is enabled for all strings when using `render_template_string()` so I guess there is no XSS here"

Let's prove it: <br>

As expected, I have succeeded in extracting the configuration variables. I crafted a payload that used for RCE and attempt to read the flag via `os` class from global objects ( do not forget to wrap it between `{{` and `}}` ):

```
config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat flag').read()
```

# zoo feedback form (100 pts)
As previous challenge, this time we meet Flask again xD 
I was also given the source code and URL for this challenge. We got a single website with a feature that allows us to submit feedback to the server. Then the server prints back my feedback to me <br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b2750bd-cd80-4f8d-a223-46e996e54204)

When observing the application, I found that they implemented XML for transmitting data between client and server, this has inadvertently exposed a vulnerability it should not existed. Let's prove for XXE injection!<br>
At line 9, server accepts user input without filtering or sanitization and then parses it as an XML document and return the root node.
Next the server will find feedback node and get its value, then render the feedback's value as a template string

Now we've got all informations that we need for the exploitation, let's try to retrive `/etc/passwd`:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e95db890-dc27-4cc3-a09d-da957a09d571)

Whoooops, Gotcha !! Now I can change the file path to `/app/flag.txt` to get the flag

**FLAG: `DUCTF{emU_say$_he!!0_h0!@_ci@0}`**
