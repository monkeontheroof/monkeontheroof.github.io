Hello everyone, this is my first blog post as I officially join a CTF competition for the first time (although I didn't get higher ranking). DownUnderCTF 2024 is quite interesting and beginner friendly, let's dive into some Web Challenges!!<br>
<!-- <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1232921552899670089/1259443092885344356/fish4finn-certificate.png?ex=66a21cc8&is=66a0cb48&hm=d1949289593e81f5415cb28eaac1e95c6be9041155feed50653689526b3c9fda&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=662&height=468" style="width: 400px"> -->

# parrot the emu (100 pts)
Come to our first challenge, I was given the source code attachment and challenge URL.<br>
<!-- <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b55e55b-573a-4273-b760-253783f5469e"> -->

After investigating, I found that this site uses Flask as a web framework and has a feature that prints back anything I entered <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97893fac-f0b2-4cb4-a5ed-14dcd93d93d8"></kbd> <br>

Take a look at `app.py`, we can see that at line 12 our input is passed directly into `render_template_string()` without filtering or sanitization, then the appended result will be rendered using `index.html`. <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f5393b-1582-447e-b334-740379909e8c"></kbd> <br>
This may have the potential for SSTI since my input is passed directly into template rather than passed in as data
> "Since autoescaping is enabled for all strings when using `render_template_string()` so I guess there is no XSS here"

Let's prove it: <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/926ff2c4-4586-4dcd-bc5d-da3b804776a8"></kbd> <br>
As expected, I have successfully extracted the configuration variables. I crafted a payload that used for RCE and attempt to read the flag via `os` class from global objects *( do not forget to place it between double curly braces )*:

```
config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat flag').read()
```

**What have I learned:** New concepts and SSTI exploitation for Flask. <br>

# zoo feedback form (100 pts)
As previous challenge, this time we meet Flask again xD <br>
I was also given the source code and URL for this challenge. We got a single website with a feature that allows us to submit feedback to the server. Then the server prints back my feedback to me <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b2750bd-cd80-4f8d-a223-46e996e54204"></kbd> <br>

When observing the application, I found that they implemented XML for transmitting data between client and server, this has inadvertently exposed a vulnerability it should not existed. Let's prove for XXE injection!<br>
At line 9, server accepts user input without filtering or sanitization and then parses it as an XML document and return the root node.
Next the server will find feedback node and get its value, then render the feedback's value as a template string <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eca07dd-57e0-4dfc-b340-ac0e2ff75f4c"></kbd>

Now we've got all informations that we need for the exploitation, let's try to retrieve a system file. Ex: `/etc/passwd` <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e95db890-dc27-4cc3-a09d-da957a09d571"></kbd>

Whoooops, Gotcha !! Now I can change the file path to `/app/flag.txt` to get the flag

**What I have learned:** Different types of Markup languages and their vulnerability type. <br>

# co2 (100 pts)
Same as previous, this time I also got a docker compose file so I'm gonna build it locally. <br>
Once again, Flask!!! It seems like I'm quite lucky to participate in this competition because it is also an opportunity for me to expand my knowledge about Flask as well as Python in general. <br>
After some trial and error, I came up with these informations:
- The flag is located at `/get_flag`, but we cannot get the flag since it is expecting the `flag` environment variable to be true *(contrary to the value in the .env file)*
- The save feedback feature merges user's JSON input into the properties of a Feedback object and saves them locally on the server.
- Discovered some hints in the source code:

> "Not quite sure how many fields we want for this, lets just collect these bits now and increase them later." <br>
> "Is it possible to dynamically add fields to this object based on the fields submitted by users?"

Combining the above informations, we could try to prove for Server-side Prototype Pollution:
First, make a POST request to `/save_feedback` with additional fields: <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/233e2b27-e3fc-4e26-aec4-7635d018846c"></kbd>

In docker container, find those saved feedbacks at `/app/feedback`. If it successfully parsed, we could see those injected fields in feedback files: <br>
> Even though properties starting with double underscore "__" are not written to file, they are still be merged into Feedback object <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/129203a4-312c-4a43-a6fd-2a668ffcfe9f" width=500></kbd> <br>

Change the payload like below to set the `flag` env to `true`:

```json
{"title":"test","content":"test","rating":"1","referred":"test",
"__class__":{
"__init__":{
"__globals__":{
"flag":"true"}}}}
```

Route to `/get_flag` to get the flag

**What I have learned:** Learned a new bug type that I've never done before, it just took me an hour to learn and solve this lab xD <br>
**FLAG: `DUCTF{_cl455_p0lluti0n_ftw_}`**

# hah got em (129 pts)
The source code for this challenge is quite small, and in fact, the challenge itself was not too difficult. Let's unzip and dissect the attachment to see what's inside!<br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60c2e9aa-3633-4a8e-be80-b7675b3a063b"></kbd> <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9102b05-a3ea-421d-9c06-d70ede8568a2"></kbd> <br>

This challenge consists of nothing more than an empty webpage with a status of Not Found. Soon, I discovered that the Dockerfile is using an external library called `Gotenberg`, which is a stateless API used for PDF files. <br>

> According to [Gotenberg documentation](https://gotenberg.dev/docs/routes#url-into-pdf-route), we can use this API to convert URL into PDF <br>

I tried with `example.com` and the result looks like this: <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e7f0a0b-2eaf-41c4-b04b-08ed12d55aec" width="700"></kbd> <br>

So that's all we need, since this challenge by default does not implement any functionality or security mechanisms. So it is highly likely that we can exploit this to trick the server into converting any system file to PDF. Let's try with `file://` URL scheme: <br>

```bash
curl --request POST https://web-hah-got-em-20ac16c4b909.2024.ductf.dev/forms/chromium/convert/url --form url=file://localhost/etc/passwd -o my.pdf
```

<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/165f718c-7629-4568-b7a8-a374beeef26f" width="700"></kbd> <br>
As expected, I was able to get the `/etc/passwd` file. Now I can get the flag by changing the url argument: <br>

```bash
curl --request POST https://web-hah-got-em-20ac16c4b909.2024.ductf.dev/forms/chromium/convert/url --form url=file://localhost/etc/flag.txt -o my.pdf
```

# i am confusion (166 pts)
This is the last one that I have sovled , this challenge only has 2 attachments: `server.js` and `package.json`. Access to the challenge's site directly to observe. <br>
During the initial reconnaissance, I located the flag at `/admin.html` but we cannot login as an admin<br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20fa37a4-19ca-4325-bd75-83958ce144d3"></kbd> <br>
Since brute-forcing is no longer an option, and with the given hint I saw at `/login.html`, at this point I immediately suspected that there might be an issue with the application's token handling mechanism. Here's summary of the JWT processing flow for this challenge:<br>
First when we login, the application will sign a token using `RS256` and included it in the Cookie header <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fd10b8e-aec2-4b0b-93b0-2776494176de"></kbd> <br>
For each endpoint, we need to specify a valid signed token to access the content. But this time, the server subsequently uses both `RS256` and `HS256` for verifying token, very interesting! <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd800826-a54b-4d68-b9f5-064153ad0590"></kbd> <br>

I guess you saw the problem too, let's prove for JWT confusion attack: <br>
First we need to find the server's public key, this can be achieved by using this `Github repo` [rsa_sign2n](https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n/tree/release/standalone) to calculate RSA public keys based on two valid signed token. <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/597b44f7-ab1a-44c4-a72b-552e049ded17"></kbd> <br>
> "Try to send a request containing each token forged by the script, only one of those will be accepted by the server" <br>

The second one worked for me so I'll take its `.pem` key file (generated by the script) to sign a new token with value `{'user':'admin'}` <br>
Base64 encode the `.pem` key file and use it to sign a new token: <br>

```bash
─(monkeontheroof㉿Monkeontheroof)-[~]
└─$ echo `base64 pubkey.rsa`
LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFVCTElDIEtFWS0tLS0tCk1JSUJDZ0tDQVFFQXJqeWJOTlMzU1Q4VmZV b0FJaHZsWkp0TnM5dGcwSzIrYkFweU50Y1d2R0QvYlJFSm5JMXEKbGMwSk9vRjhaOHpPRVNncEpv cmdTSHNQSDZ2K2hnT2UzQklOaE90aHJpRWJhbWg3R1ZHSTljUUdTRkRIbmNEaQp1YUFGY21NWXQr T0dpRzJ3SXpLSjluaHI2UXhBNWszS0FRLzV4QU1NVUs4b0FPTFVHMUpRWXpmQ2t0R3BjaVNICnk5 MDEyam1oc3pVWG9KNU1RcEJueUZWRDZZYTNZTS8xcFdXV1NWTXhnbEh2NlYwdkhBajg3OCtPRkxZ QldwNWwKZFd6QXRGLzBmN1hES1UwSnFoNGZFU2Z2UFFKNUIvSERrOFdNemhXTkVZeHM3bFpBdkpx bTBoY3REZ0JTOWkxVwpqOTg1dCtMYXp1bnFySExRc0l1MHlQb1NuM1dGWUkrOVl3SURBUUFCCi0t LS0tRU5EIFJTQSBQVUJMSUMgS0VZLS0tLS0K
```

With `JWT editor` Burp extension, create a new symmetric key with the value `k` replaced by the Base64 encoded key mentioned above. <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32e3b0c4-72cb-4cb2-b35e-2d75aebbc9cc"></kbd> <br>
Change the `user`'s value into admin and sign the token using the symmetric key we created (also change the `alg` to `HS256`) and navigate to `/admin.html` to get the flag <br>
<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e0cf6f3-bb70-4300-9624-97d3d60387c8"></kbd>

**What I have learned:** New attack technique could be useful for testing server's JWT handling mechanisms. <br>

Thank you so much for reading my very first blog :> I have also solved some OSINT challenges but haven't written write-up for it yet, maybe next post xD. See you in the next CTF!!
