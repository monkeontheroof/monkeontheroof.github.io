Hello everyone, this is my first blog post as I officially join a CTF competition for the first time (although I didn't get higher ranking). DownUnderCTF 2024 is quite interesting and beginner friendly, let's dive into some Web Challenges!!<br>

Come to our first challenge, I was given the source code attachment and the challenge's URL, let's go through it <br>

After investigating, I found that this site has a feature that allows me to enter anything and print it back to me

Take a look at `app.py`, we can see that at line 12 our input is passed directly into `render_template_string()` without filtering or sanitization, then the appended result will be rendered using `index.html`. <br>

This may have the potential for SSTI since my input is passed directly into template rather than passed in as data
> "Since autoescaping is enabled for all strings when using `render_template_string()` so there is no XSS here" <br>

Let's prove it: <br>

As expected, I have succeeded in extracting the configuration variables. I crafted a payload that used for RCE and attempt to read the flag:
```python
{{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('ls').read() }}
```
